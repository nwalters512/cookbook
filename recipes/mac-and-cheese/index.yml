title: Mac and Cheese
ingredients:
  - 8 ounces pasta (elbow macaroni work well)
  - 3 tablespoons butter
  - 3 tablespoons flour
  - 1 tablespoons powdered mustard
  - 3 cups milk
  - 1/2 cup yellow onion, finely diced
  - 1 bay leaf
  - 1/2 teaspoon paprika
  - 1 large egg
  - 12 ounces sharp cheddar, divided (9 ounces / 3 ounces)
  - 1 teaspoon kosher salt
  - Fresh black pepper
  - 3 tablespoon butter
  - 1 cup panko bread crumbs
steps:
  - Preheat oven to 350°F; grease 2 quart casserole dish.
  - Start to boil water for pasta.
  - In separate pot (a dutch oven works well), melt 3 tablespoons butter. Whisk in flour and mustard and stir for approximately 5 minutes. Make sure it’s free of lumps.
  - Stir in milk, onion, bay leaf, and paprika. Simmer for 10 minutes, stirring frequently.
  - While sauce cooks, boil pasta to al dente.
  - Temper the egg into the sauce. Stir in 9 ounces of the cheese. Season with salt and pepper.
  - Fold the pasta into the mix and pour into the casserole dish. Top with remaining cheese.
  - Melt 3 tablespoons butter in a saute pan and toss the bread crumbs to coat. Top the pasta with the bread crumbs.
  - Bake for 30 minutes. Remove from oven and rest for 5 minutes before serving.
notes:
  - Use Barilla "protein" pasta to up the nutritional value.
  - Experiment with different types and ratios of cheese - pepperjack adds a nice kick!
