title: Minnestrone
ingredients:
  - 4 slices bacon, cut into 1/4" slices
  - 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
  - 4 cloves garlic, minced
  - 2 carrots, peeled and cut into 1/4" dice
  - 1 onion, peeled and cut into 1/4" dice
  - 1 leek (white part and 1" green), quartered lengthwise, well-rinsed, and cut into 1/4" thick slices
  - 3 cups finely shredded cabbage
  - 2 medium zucchini, quartered lengthwise and cut into 1/4" slices
  - 1 Idaho potato, peeled and cut into 1/4" dice
  - 6 cups low-sodium chicken broth
  - 2 cups (or one can) low sodium beef broth
  - 1 can tomato paste
  - 5 tablespoons chopped fresh Italian (flat leaf) parsley, divided
  - 2 teaspoons dried oregano (or 2 tablespoons fresh)
  - 3/4 teaspoons dried basil (or 1 1/2 tablespoons fresh)
  - 1 teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper
  - Salt to taste
  - 1 can red kidney beans, drained and rinsed
  - 4 ripe plum tomatoes, seeded and cut into 1/4" dice
  - 1/2 - 1 cup small pasta, e.g. ditali
  - Freshly grated Parmesan cheese for garnish
steps:
  - Cook the bacon in a large soup pot over low heat to render the fat, about 10 minutes. Let it get just a little bit crisp.
  - Add the butter and, when it has melted, add the garlic, carrots, onion, and leek and raise the heat slightly. Cover and wilt the vegetables for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.
  - Add the cabbage, zucchini, potato, both stocks and tomato paste. Bring to a boil.
  - Reduce the heat and add 2 tablespoons of parsley and the oregano, basil, pepper and salt. Simmer over medium heat for 15 minutes.
  - Add the kidney beans, tomatoes, and pasta. Simmer until pasta is tender, about 10 minutes.
  - Before serving, stir in the remaining parsley. You can add water if the soup is too thick and will probably need to do so when serving the leftovers.
  - Top with Parmesan.
