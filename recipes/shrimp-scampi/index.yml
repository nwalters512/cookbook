title: Shrimp Scampi
ingredients:
  - 1 tablespoon olive oil
  - 2 tablespoons butter, divided
  - 2 large garlic cloves, minced
  - 8 ounces shrimp (roughly; about 7 per serving)
  - Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
  - 1/4 cup dry white wine (I like sauvignon blanc)
  - 1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
  - 1 tablespoon lemon juice (about ½ a lemon if you’re squeezing fresh)
  - 1/8 cup chopped parsley
steps:
  - Prep all ingredients before cooking. The shrimp cooks quickly and will overcook if you prep as you go along.
  - Heat olive oil and 1 tablespoon butter in large pan or skillet. Add garlic. Saute until fragrant (about 30 seconds); don’t let it brown.
  - Add shrimp and season with salt/pepper. Saute for 1-2 minutes on one side (until just beginning to turn pink).
  - Flip the shrimp and immediately pour in wine and add red pepper flakes.
  - Bring to a simmer for 1-2 minutes or until wine reduces by about half and the shrimp is cooked through, being careful not to overcook.
  - Stir in 1 tablespoon butter, lemon juice, and parsley. Remove from heat immediately.
notes:
  - Great served over rice or pasta (I like angel hair).
