title: Tinga de Pollo
ingredients:
  - 2 bone in, skin on chicken breasts
  - 1 large onion, roughly chopped
  - 2 cloves garlic
  - 1 cup chicken stock
  - 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar
  - 14oz can crushed fire roasted tomatoes
  - 1 can chipotle chiles in adobo sauce
  - 1 teaspoon ground cumin
  - 1 teaspoon Mexican oregano
  - Kosher salt
  - Freshly ground pepper
steps:
  - Start by searing two bone-in, skin-on chicken breasts in a large saucepot.
  - Once the chicken is seared on both sides, remove and add in roughly chopped large onion and cloves of garlic then sauteing those for about 2 minutes.
  - Deglaze with chicken stock, apple cider vinegar, canned crushed fire-roasted tomatoes, and chipotle chiles in adobo sauce, and ground cumin and Mexican oregano. Mix to combine.
  - Bring everything to a rolling simmer and drop the chicken breasts back into the pot. Cover and braise for 45 minutes.
  - After 45 minutes, pull the chicken out and use an immersion blender to blend the vegetables and chiles into a smooth but a little chunky sauce.
  - Remove the chicken breast bone and skin then place back to the pot seasoning with kosher salt and freshly ground pepper then simmer for 10 minutes. Taste for seasoning.
