title: Pasta with Sausage, Kale, and White Beans
description: An easy one-pot meal with hearty, deep flavor.
ingredients:
  - 1 onion
  - 6 garlic cloves
  - Fresh oregano
  - 12 ounces kale
  - 1 pound hot or sweet Italian sausage
  - 15 ounce can cannellini beans
  - 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
  - 1/2 teaspoon fennel seeds
  - 1/8 teaspoon red pepper flakes
  - 3 cups chicken broth
  - 8 ounces orecchiette
  - 1 ounce Pecorino Romano cheese
  - Salt and pepper
steps:
  - Chop onion fine. Mince garlic. Mince 1 1/2 teaspoons oregano. Stem kale by cutting away leafy green portion from either side of stalk, then chop leaves into even-size pieces. Remove casings from sausage. Drain and rinse from beans.
  - Heat 1 tablespoon oil in Dutch oven over medium-high heat until just smoking. Add sausage and cook, breaking meat into 1/2-inch pieces, until lightly browned, 5 to 7 minutes.
  - Stir in beans and onino and cook until onion is softened, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in fennel seeds, pepper flakes, garlic, and oregano and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.
  - Stir in broth and 1 cup water, increase heat to high, and bring to boil. Stir in pasta and half of kale. Cover, reduce heat to medium, and simmer vigorously for 4 minutes. Place remaining kale in pot without stirring, cover, and continue to cook until kale is just tender, about 4 minutes.
  - While pasta cooks, grate Pecorino (1/2 cup).
  - Uncover, stir to incorporate kale, and simmer, uncovered and stirring occasionally, until most of liquid is absorbed and orecchiette is tender, 3 to 6 minutes. Off heat, stir in Pecorino and remaining 1 tablespoon oil. Season with salt and pepper to taste, and serve.
